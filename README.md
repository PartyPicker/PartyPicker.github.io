Investigating building a political party picking system

Next steps: 
- Add more data (policies and topics)
- Keep policies a darker colour once selected
- Combine identical policies, so multiple parties represent it
- Change bar chart, so it simply adds the selected policies, rather than creating a percentage of total party policies
- Add submit button, so people see the results after they submit
- Make bar chart appear only after submit button is pressed
- Add a page / dropdown box which has a summary for each party - core beliefs, brief history
- Add basic profile / login - google/facebook - (+ linked to voteflow)
- Add function for people to rate parties by trust
- Add a "Name Your Custom Party" function, so people can name the party based on their custom combination of policies +  add an image for the logo
- Add your own policies to your custom party
- Add a printable summary page of results - bar chart, custom party name + logo, pie chart
- Create database for more automated data input
- See who is similar to you function - (maybe linked through VoteFLow?)
- Select people to represent you in specific topics

Ambition 1: evolve into project boost cycle platform
-----------------------------------------------------

Some general principles to work towards:

- Needs-centred dialogue (similar to Nonviolent Communication)
- Socio-ecological context
- Empiricism
- Automation
- Cooperation
- Consent

People don't "vote" agree/disagree on proposals, instead there are facilitated stages and rounds to meet community needs and solve problems. These stages represent a cycle. The method is often made dynamic and enjoyable by the facilitator. 

Here is the first proposal; a cyclic process to solve problems and meet community needs, taken from the Equality Action Hub:


Project Boost Cycle Method
This process goes through boost cycles [of 90 days] where the whole community gathers together to give energy to one project, policy or action during the cycle. This project, policy or single action is chosen when the countdown ends, and whichever project that is highest rated within the [30 day] countdown will be the one acted upon. Of course any group can work on any other project they wish, but if everyone focuses effort on one project during the boost cycle, there will be greater overall impact in a shorter time.


Hereâ€™s what each person can do within the method: 
List [six] essential community needs
Add a whole project, a policy or a single action to the database
Rate these projects, policies and actions on:
Potential impact
Achievability now
Which [3] community needs it will satisfy most
How enthusiastic you are about it
Give support, resources, and/or skills to the chosen project 


The cycle:
| Plan - 30 days planning the chosen project
| Act - 30 days implementing and/or boosting a project, policy or single action
| Reflect - 30 days data gathering, evaluation, discussion, reflection. 

At the beginning of the reflection period, the countdown resets. During this time, people can change or add ratings to projects, policies or single actions.
